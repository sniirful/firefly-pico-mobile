# Firefly-Pico Mobile
Simple Android wrapper app for your [Firefly-Pico](https://github.com/cioraneanu/firefly-pico) instance.

## Why this app
You probably won't need it, but if you:
1. have Firefly-Pico self-hosted;
2. cannot use an HTTPS certificate for whatever reason;
3. have an Android phone;

then this app might suit you.

## Installation
The only way at the moment is to compile it yourself.
